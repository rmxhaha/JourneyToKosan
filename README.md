JourneyToKosan 
==============

### By rmxhaha & ParadiseCatz

Thomas is a first-year ITB student who doesn't have a clue on how to survive the college life. It's rainy season in Bandung at the time. The wind breezes and the sky is overcast with thick dark clouds. Little did he know that his skin cell will get burnt with every raindrop that touches him.

Thomas is now at the front gate of ITB and is going to get back to kosan. Will you rescue him all through his journey?

Avoid Thomas from being drenched in toxic raindrops by adjusting his umbrella.
